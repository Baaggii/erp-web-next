# Coding Table Dynamic Field Handling

Some coding tables populate transactional metadata such as `TRTYPENAME` and `trtype` by running MySQL triggers that update the row after it is inserted.  Bulk inserts that relied on those triggers forced MySQL to run an `UPDATE` on the same table for every row, which created contention and was difficult to troubleshoot.

The upload workflow now recognizes the coding tables that require these dynamic fields (`transactions_income`, `transactions_expense`, `transactions_order`, and `transactions_plan`).  When one of these tables is selected the UI no longer emits bulk INSERT SQL.  Instead it streams each row to `/api/coding_tables/upsert-row`, which fills in the dynamic fields by reading from `code_transaction` before performing an upsert.  This keeps the logic in application code and avoids self-updating triggers altogether.

Because the helper takes care of populating the dynamic fields, any trigger snippets that try to `UPDATE` the same table are ignored when SQL scripts are generated.  Administrators should remove those trigger blocks from existing configurationsâ€”the new API path now guarantees the dynamic metadata will be present without relying on database triggers.
