# Temporary posting with senior reviewers

Use this checklist to manually verify that the **Post** button bypasses forwarding when the reviewer still has a senior reviewer assigned.

1. Sign in with a user who can post transactions but also has a plan senior (so review forwarding is normally available).
2. Open a temporary submission awaiting your review and click **Promote** to load it into the form.
3. Click **Post**.
4. Confirm the transaction is posted immediately (status `promoted`), and no additional forwarding steps or reviewer assignments are added.
5. Repeat with the same user after toggling any “force resolve pending drafts” control to ensure the Post action still posts directly and does not create a forwarded draft.
