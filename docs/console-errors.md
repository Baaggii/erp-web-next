# Console errors related to browser extensions

Several error strings reported in the browser console are not generated by the ERP codebase itself but by browser extensions that inject content scripts into every page. Two common messages are:

- `Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.`
- `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.`

These messages come from extensions that call `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or similar APIs without a listening background script. When that happens the browser surfaces `runtime.lastError`, even though the page itself is not using Chrome extension APIs.

## Why you might see these messages here

- Extensions such as VCAST or other developer tooling inject `browserAction.js`/`IframeCoordinator` scripts into every page. Those scripts attempt to message their background worker whether or not the page expects it.
- Because the ERP web app does not include a Chrome extension, there is no receiving endpoint for those messages, so Chrome reports the `runtime.lastError` warnings in the console.

## How to keep the console clean during development

- Disable third-party extensions while testing the ERP web app or open the page in an incognito window with extensions turned off.
- If you must keep the extension enabled, ignore these warnings—they are harmless for the ERP app and do not affect functionality.
- Alternatively, create a separate browser profile dedicated to ERP development so extension noise does not pollute the console output.

No code changes inside this repository are necessary to remove these warnings because they originate entirely from the browser environment.
