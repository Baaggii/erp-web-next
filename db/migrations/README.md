# Migrations

Legacy migrations have been moved to the `archive/` directory. New migrations should be added here and executed relative to the baseline schema defined in `../schema.sql`.

## Current migrations

- `2025-10-30_code_identifier_columns.sql` â€” adds the `chig_id`, `torol_id`, and `baitsaagch_id` lookup identifiers now represented in the schema baseline.
